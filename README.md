The purpose of the JetDC app or the Jet-A1 Density Calculator is to be a tool for people working with aviation fuel. There is alot of reporting and measuring that is somewhat done manually with sliding discs and spreadsheets, just to do the same as a simple calculation.
Well to even simplify it furher I have made this app that does 3 separate calculations depending on what value you are looking for.

The functions and Calculations:
1. Get Density at X ÂºC --> This function takes the current temperature of your batch and assumes you know the refference density at 15C, it then calculates a density for you at the given density.
2. Get Mixed Batch Density --> This is for when you mix 2 different batches of fuel, it assumes you have the refference density given at 15C for each of the batches.
3. Get Density at 15C --> This calculation assumes you have taken a measurment of temperature and density, these are you inputs and it will return your Density at 15C also known as you refference density.

   IMPORTANT!
   This app is designed to calculate the density of Jet-A1 aviation fuel, it runs 3 different calculations with different inputs.
   The "Get Density at 15C" and "Get Density at x_C, are both dependent on a ALPHA value(the coefficient on how much the density changes per one degree Celsius)
   The Alpha value is set at 0.0009 as default.
   But if you are dealing with perhaps another supplier this value can vary.
   Hence below is the option to change and save a new ALPHA Value if needed.
   ###DISCLAIMER###
   This application is not made together with or is in affiliation with any Aviation Fuel provider.
   It is crucial that you check your own inputs and values against the criteria of your work. JetDC does not take any responsibility of any wrongly used values potentially taken from this application!

Currently there is only a debug-version available and only for Android users:
The Application can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PL4LHCV0AYPC-2s1i6J6v9vzO9zlYddh/view?usp=drive_link
Potentially there will be a full release on the Play store after some testing in real life.
